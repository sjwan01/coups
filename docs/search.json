    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nCoups are a subject that political scientists have studied for a long time. Characterized by their sudden and violent nature, coups unlawfully seize power from governments and cast huge impact on people’s lives - not only within the territory but also in the states closely connected to it. This makes understanding coups a crucial task, as it could help scholars as well as relevant stakeholders make decisions in advance to get ready for the upcoming political or geopolitical crises. For instance,\n\ngovernment officials could prepare policies ahead of time to respond to the new geopolitical environment, and\ninvestors could make plans in order to avoid economic loss.\n\nIn this project, we will examine regime types of countries as a contributing factor to the coup events as well as their results. In general, regimes - the form of governments - can be categorized into democracies, non-democracies, and interim governments. Examples of sub-categories include presidential democracy, oligarchy, warlordism, so on and so forth.\nGiven a historical list of past coup events (1945 - 2022), we explore the role of regime types during coups in relation to various other factors. For instance, how did political stability change across regime types? What distinguished attributes did the rulers have under different forms of government? Also, we want to examine how regimes behave differently - or similarly - during coups provided some set of factors: are parliamentary democratic governments similar to presidential democratic governments? Are democratic governments and autarchic governments on the opposite ends with respect to political violence?\nBeyond this, the project studies how statistics of coup events varied across time and space. In our generation, we probably feel that coups are less likely to happen these days comparing to, let’s say, the 70s. However, is that true? Will coups ultimately stop happening across the globe as we - or a small portion of us - are living a better and better life, or are they inevitable events due to human nature?"

    "section": "2.1 Description",
    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe project makes use of datasets from the following sources:\n\nCoup d’État Project (CDP)\nRulers, Elections, and Irregular Governance dataset (REIGN)\n\n\n2.1.1 The CDP Data\nThe CDP data is collected by the Cline Center for Advanced Social Research at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. It was a collaborative work by Buddy Peyton, Joseph Bajjalieh, Dan Shalmon, Michael Martin, Jonathan Bonaguro, and Scott Althaus.\nThe CDP data is about coup instances. For each instance, it records information concerning\n\nwhen and where it took place,\nthe type of its initiator (e.g. military, rebels),\nthe coup outcome (realized or not, or it is just a thwarted conspiracy),\nthe fate of the deposed leader (e.g. jailed, fled).\n\nIn its latest version, this dataset identifies 981 coup instances with 22 attributes from 1945 to 2022 and is in the CSV format. On average, new instances and attributes are updated every 6 months, starting from November 16th 2022 to February 24rd 2023.\n\n\n2.1.2 The REIGN Data\nThe REIGN data is collected by Curtis Bell, Clayton Besaw, and Matthew Frank in the CSV format. In general, it contains data concerning\n\nthe political leadership,\nthe regime characteristics,\nthe electoral outcomes\n\nfor every country around the globe since January 1950. Each aspect is described through numerous measures in the dataset, and in total, this massive dataset has 137,219 observations with 41 descriptive features by January 2021. Some noticeable numerical features are:\n\nage: the national leader’s age\ntenure_months: the number of months a leader has been in power\nlastelection: an inverted decay function that measures the time since the last election for the leadership position of the country\ndem_duration: the logged number of months under democratic ruling\npolitical_violence: the relative level (Z-score) of political violence experienced within the borders of a country for that year\nprecip: the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for each country month\ncouprisk: an estimated probability of the risk of a military coup attempt\n\nNotice that the REIGN is not coup-specific. It is a supporting source that helps us better describe the political ecosystem of a country experiencing coups. So far, this dataset has been updated for 30 times starting from February 7th, 2019 to August 3rd, 2021.\n\n\n2.1.3 References\nYou may access more informative data descriptions with codebooks for the CDP and the REIGN data (download links provided at the end of both webpages), and you may download the latest data to your local environment for the CDP and the REIGN data.\nNote: due to maintenance issues, the REIGN data cannot be downloaded directly from their website but can be obtained through their GitHub repo.\n\n\n2.1.4 Data Import\nWe have made a copy of the datasets and saved them in the ./data/raw folder of this project. This makes us - as well as you - to import the data.\nAs mentioned, the REIGN data serves as a supporting role. As a preprocessing step, we will merge the REIGN data with the CDP data using keys country, year, and month and keep instances in the CDP data unique. You may find the merged data in the ./data/merged folder.\n\n\nCode\n# read both data from the project repo\ncdp &lt;- read.csv(\"./data/raw/Coup data 2.1.2.csv\")\nreign &lt;- read.csv(\"./data/raw/REIGN_2021_8.csv\")\n\n# merged data using keys\nmerged &lt;- cdp %&gt;% \n  left_join(reign, by = c(\"cowcode\"=\"ccode\", \"year\"=\"year\", \"month\"=\"month\")) %&gt;%\n  # duplicates may occur if leadership changed in the year of coups\n  distinct(coup_id, .keep_all = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  select(-country.y) %&gt;% rename(country = country.x)\n\n# export the merged data\nwrite.csv(merged, file = \"./data/merged/coup_data.csv\", row.names = FALSE)\n\nmerged &lt;- read.csv(\"./data/merged/coup_data.csv\")\n\n\nNotice that, because observations in both datasets can be dated long ago, it can be expected that there will be many missing values, and they also depend on the geographical location - countries might not be able to provide data for particular measures at some time. In addition, while our data describes the political aspects of countries in a comprehensive manner, bear in mind that coups are also significantly related to economic and social attributes. Although our data provides no information concerning these, feel free to be inspired and add more features for further studies!"

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan (TODO)\nWe merge the two datasets to provide a more comprehensive picture on the political backgrounds of the coups. Using a left join from the REIGN data to the CDP data, we introduce additional information such as the type of government, coup risk, level of political violence, among many others at the time of the coup. With the merged dataset, we seek to answer the questions posed in the introduction in the following ways:\n\nData Exploration: We will visualize the distribution of all features using a variety of plots – barplots, scatterplots, Cleveland dot plots – as appropriate to gain an initial understanding to the data we are working with. This will allow us to decide what features to pay special attention to in the following steps.\nClustering: We will apply PCA to the numerical features mentioned above (added from the REIGN) data to perform dimension reduction before drawing the biplot. We will then be able to see clusters of the different types of government at the time of the coups and identify any outliers. Depending on whether the clusters are clear, we will also be able to infer if the type of government is highly correlated with coups happening. On the other hand, the biplot also provides insight into highly correlated and uncorrelated features, if there are any.\nTime series analysis: Since the data we have range from 1945 to 2020, it provides a great opportunity for us to conduct time series analysis. We plan to at least group the coups by type of government and by region, respectively, to see if the number of coups changed over the span of 75 years. We will also conduct additional time series analysis for any notable factors that stand out from the previous biplot."

    "section": "2.3 Missing Value Analysis",
    "text": "2.3 Missing Value Analysis\nWe start with exploring the distribution of missing values in our data.\n\n\nCode\nplot_missing(merged, num_char = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe noticed that the data has complete records of the majority instances. Around 40% of the instances only miss couprisk and pctile_risk data, while less than 10% of the instances miss majority of attribute data. In addition, around half of the instances do not have couprisk and pctile_risk data.\nAccording to the codebook, couprisk is a probability estimated using machine learning and stacking algorithms, and this measure started in January, 1975. At the meantime, pctile_risk corresponds to the percentile risk for each country’s estimated risk of a military coup attempt, and therefore, couprisk and pctile_risk are correlated in their missing patterns.\nSimilarly, let’s also observe the missing patterns among the continuous data we defined in the data section, as we will fit PCA on them to analyze how regime types are compared with each other.\n\n\nCode\nnumerical &lt;- c(\"age\", \"tenure_months\", \"lastelection\", \"dem_duration\",\n               \"political_violence\", \"precip\", \"couprisk\")\nplot_missing(select(merged, all_of(numerical)))\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found that missing values are common in this dataset. Did they occur by chance or follow some patterns? We suspect they are related to the time and geographical location - for early observations, some measures such as couprisk were not yet effective, and particular countries might not take some measures locally and thus have no records.\nTo prove that our hypothesis is valid, we plot a heatmap of number of missing values by period and region. We determine the count of missing values for a specific period and region by adding up the number of missing values for instances of coups that occurred in that region during the given period.\n\n\nCode\nnas_by_year &lt;- merged %&gt;%\n  mutate(cowcode = case_when(\n    cowcode == 260 ~ 255,\n    cowcode == 340 ~ 345,\n    cowcode == 393 ~ 365,\n    TRUE ~ cowcode\n  ), year = case_when(\n    year &lt; 1960 ~ \"&lt;1960\",\n    year &lt; 1970 ~ \"1960-1969\",\n    year &lt; 1980 ~ \"1970-1979\",\n    year &lt; 1990 ~ \"1980-1989\",\n    year &lt; 2000 ~ \"1990-1999\",\n    year &lt; 2010 ~ \"2000-2009\",\n    TRUE ~ \"2010-2022\"\n  )) %&gt;%\n  mutate(region = countrycode(cowcode, \n                              origin = \"cown\",\n                              destination = \"region\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(na_count = rowSums(is.na(.))) %&gt;%\n  group_by(year, region) %&gt;%\n  summarize(sum_nas = sum(na_count)) %&gt;%\n  select(all_of(c(\"year\", \"region\", \"sum_nas\")))\n\ntheme_heat &lt;- theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.line = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))\n\nggplot(nas_by_year, aes(x = region, y = year)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill = sum_nas)) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"yellow\", high = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Number of NAs by Year and Region\",\n       x = \"Region\",\n       y = \"Period\",\n       fill = \"No. of NAs\") +\n  theme_heat\n\n\n\n\n\nIt turned out the our hypothesis is correct - coups took place in Latin America and Caribbean before 1960 explain most of the missing values. During this time period, coups happened outside of North America, South Asian, and Sub-Saharan Africa also contributed to the total count.\nWhy are there blank areas? Because there are no coups in Canada and the United States until 2021. What happened in 2021? Check January 6 United States Capitol attack."

    "text": "3.1 What Forms of Governments Relate with Coups the Most?\nCan the regime type of a country infer whether it will encounter a coup in the future? To answer this question, we come up with some factors that relate to the occurrence of coup events using common sense, and then discuss the relationship between regime types and these factors. Eventually, we shall see similarities and differences among these different relations.\nTo start with, it would be straightforward to think that - if countries under some form of government experience more coup incidents, then the regime type is more likely to incur coup events. Provided that, we see the distribution of coups group by regime types.\n\n\nCode\njoined %&gt;%\n  group_by(government) %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n()) %&gt;%\n  mutate(government = fct_reorder(government, count)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = fct_rev(government), y = count)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"cornflowerblue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Coups by Regimes\") +\n  xlab(\"\") +\n  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the histogram, we see personal dictatorship has the highest likelihood to experience coups. While it makes sense that dominant party, military government also share high coup frequency, it is somehow surprising to see that governments that embrace presidential democracy and parliamentary democracy are similar. We shall see whether that is a coincidence or not after considering the following factors.\nNext, it is also intuitive to infer that governments that cast more political violence on their people are more likely to face the situations in which the public is against them. Therefore, among our coup observations, we shall see the distribution of political violence index within each regime category.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(joined, aes(x = reorder(government, -political_violence, median),y = political_violence)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  ggtitle(\"Multiple Boxplots of Political Violence under Regimes\") +\n  labs(y = \"Political Violence\", x = \"Regime\") +\n  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo regime types that are eye-catching are warlordism and presidential democracy. Although all regimes, except for wardolism, share almost the same median of their political violence index, we observed that in some democratic nations there existed extremely high political violence. This can be used as a piece of evidence that explains the previous finding - why presidential democracy governments experienced relatively more coups.\nFinally, we shall see the distribution of the time period since the last election under all government forms. Notice that lastelection was calculated using inverted decay functions, which means that higher values indicate shorter period, vice versa.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(joined, aes(x = reorder(government, -lastelection, median),y = lastelection)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  ggtitle(\"Multiple Boxplots of Time Since Last Election Given Regimes\") +\n  labs(y = \"Time Since Last Election\", x = \"Regime\") +\n  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nWe observe that among the coup instances, leaders in democratic governments would have been in place much longer than those under any other regimes. The left-most boxplot indicates that for monarchical leaders, it is likely that they would be replace soon after they came to power. Usually, coup events are accompanied with the result that the leaders would be overthrown - hence, the time period since the last election gave us a new perspective, that monarchy is most likely to experience coups, while the democratic governments are the least.\nCombining the discussions concerning the frequency of coups, political violence, and time period after the last election across regime types, we found that democratic and non-democratic governments are perhaps equally likely to experience coup events. However, if we are given that some government belongs to the interim category, then it is reasonable for us to bet that there would be no coups happening.\nHowever, coup occurrences and coup results are very different - they are likely crucial. Last but not least, we check the coup results distribution across regimes, to see what forms of governments are better at handling coup incidents. Previously, we were surprised by the fact that coups were quiet often for democratic governments - however, the visualization below somehow explained our confusion.\n\n\nCode\njoined %&gt;%\n  mutate(realized = ifelse(\n    realized == 1, \"succeeded\", \"failed\"\n  )) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = government, fill = realized)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Succeeded vs. Failed Coups Distribution\") +\n  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough democratic governments faced coup events from time to time, the number of coups in which they resolved and survived won over the number of coups in which they lost power. Comparing with democratic governments, the number of coups personal dictatorship survived since 1945 is almost twice the number of those in which they did not. In addition, military governments probably survived the least proportion of coups happened to them."

    "text": "3.2 How Alike are Different Regimes\nIn this section, we aim to analyze how regimes are similar or different to each other, given some selected numerical attributes we mentioned in the data section.\nTo start with, we initiate the parallel coordinate plot for coups across the set of numerical variables, to see if categories of any of them follow comparable patterns.\n\n\nCode\nselected &lt;- c(\"government\", \"age\", \"tenure_months\", \"lastelection\",\n              \"dem_duration\", \"political_violence\", \"precip\", \"couprisk\")\n\njoined %&gt;%\n  select(all_of(selected)) %&gt;% \n  ggparcoord(columns=2:8, groupColumn=1, alpha=0.1, scale='uniminmax',splineFactor=10,\n           title = \"Parallel Coordinate Plot for Coups\")\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the parallel coordinate plot, it seems like the majority of coups follow similar patterns, but there were high variation within each category that prevents us from making the most direct conclusion. However, we noticed some takeaways that\n\nage and tenure_month, lastelection and dem_duration, precip and couprisk are negatively correlated,\ntenure_months and lastelection, political_violence and precip are positively correlated.\n\nTo further investigate how similar, or different, categories are, we can use a biplot calibrated with political_violence.\n\n\nCode\nbiplot_data &lt;- joined %&gt;% select(all_of(selected)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(government) %&gt;%\n  summarize(across(-1, ~mean(., na.rm = TRUE), .names = '{.col}')) %&gt;%\n  na.omit()\n\ndraw_biplot(biplot_data, \"political_violence\")\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the biplot, we observe some clusters and outliers, where regimes within clusters are alike, or not otherwise:\n\nCluster 1: Presidential Democracy, Parliamentary Democracy;\nCluster 2: Dominant Party, Party-Personal-Military, Party-Military;\nCluster 3: Indirect Military, Party-Personal, Personal Dictorship;\nClister 4: Military-Personal, Military, Personal-Civilian, Provisional-Military;\nOutliers: Monarchy, Wardolism.\n\nCluster 1 shares similarities in terms of dem_duration and precip, Cluster 2 shares similarities in terms of coup_risk, Cluster 3 shares similarities in terms of lastelection, and while Cluster 4 also shares similaries with coup_risk, it is the most different to Cluster 2 as they are on the most negatively correlated.\nIn addition, if we suppose higher political violence level infers higher likelihood of coup occurrence, the calibrated biplot gives us an entirely new perspective on predicting coup occurrence with regime types which disagrees with the previous boxplots of political violence. For instance, while the boxplot indicated that democratic governments are positively related with the political violence level, the biplot indicated that they are strongly negatively related with it."

Afterwards, the number went down until recent years, after the pandemic as well as the economic recession hit us. It seems like the figure will rise again!\nWhat regimes were contributing to this figure? We shall broadly classify government forms into democracy, non-democracy, and provisional classes.

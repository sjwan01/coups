## Description

In this project, we will examine regime types of countries as a contributing factor to the coup events as well as their results. In general, regimes - the form of governments - can be categorized into democracies, non-democracies, and interim governments. Given a historical list of past coup events (1945 - 2022), we explore the role of regime types during coups in relation to various other factors. Also, we want to examine how regimes behave differently - or similarly - during coups provided some set of factors.

## Data Source

- [Coup d'Ã‰tat Project (CDP)](https://clinecenter.illinois.edu/project/research-themes/democracy-and-development/coup-detat-project)
- [Rulers, Elections, and Irregular Governance dataset (REIGN)](https://oefdatascience.github.io/REIGN.github.io/menu/reign_current.html)

Detailed data descriptions and codebooks for the [CDP](https://databank.illinois.edu/datasets/IDB-3143201) and the [REIGN](https://oefdatascience.github.io/REIGN.github.io/menu/reign_current.html) data are available. Data downloads for the [CDP](https://databank.illinois.edu/datasets/IDB-3143201) and the [REIGN](https://github.com/OEFDataScience/REIGN.github.io/blob/gh-pages/data_sets/REIGN_2021_8.csv) data are accessible.

## Research Plan

The merged dataset provides a comprehensive picture of political backgrounds during coups. The research plan includes:

1. **Data Exploration:** Visualizing feature distributions and identifying patterns.
2. **Clustering:** Applying PCA for dimension reduction, identifying clustered regimes and outliers.
3. **Time Series Analysis:** Examining coup counts and political violence level by government type over the dataset's 75-year span.
